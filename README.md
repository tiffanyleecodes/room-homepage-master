### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

            onClick="plusSlides(-1)"

            onClick="plusSlides(1)"

I learned those from slideshow button function.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Slideshow](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) - This helped me for slideshow. The code make only one slide in block or grid, and remaining are none. Also make setting from last slide to the first slide.
